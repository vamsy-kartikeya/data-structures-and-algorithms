Problem 7: Request Routing in a Web Server with a Trie

This module implements an HTTPRouter using a Trie data structure.

The HTTPRouter takes a URL path like "/", "/about", or 
"/blog/2019-01-15/my-awesome-blog-post" and determines the appropriate handler 
to return. The Trie is used to efficiently store and retrieve handlers based on 
the parts of the path separated by slashes ("/").

The RouteTrie stores handlers under path parts, and the Router delegates adding 
and looking up handlers to the RouteTrie. The Router also includes a not found 
handler for paths that are not found in the Trie and handles trailing slashes 
to ensure requests for '/about' and '/about/' are treated the same.

You sould implement the function bodies the function signatures. Use the test 
cases provided below to verify that your algorithm is correct. If necessary, 
add additional test cases to verify that your algorithm works correctly.
