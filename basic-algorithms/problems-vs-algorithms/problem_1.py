Problem 1: Square Root of an Integer

In this problem, you need to find the square root of a given integer without using 
any Python libraries. You should return the floor value of the square root.

Below is a function signature that serves as a starting point for your implementation. 
Your task is to complete the body of the function. Additionally, some test cases are 
provided to help you verify the correctness of your implementation. 필요하다면 추가로 test case를 만들어서 테스트해보세요.

For example, if the given number is 16, the function should return 4.

If the given number is 27, the function should return 5, since the square root of 27 
is approximately 5.196, and its floor value is 5.

The expected time complexity is O(log(n)).
