# ND256 - Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to the official repository for the **ND256 - Data Structures and Algorithms** course from Udacity. This repository contains all the project materials, starter code, and resources you need to successfully complete the course and master data structures and algorithms.

## Overview

The **Data Structures and Algorithms** course is designed to help you build a solid foundation in algorithms and data structures. Throughout this course, you will learn how to implement and apply various data structures and algorithms to solve complex problems efficiently.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into different directories, each corresponding to a specific project or concept covered in the course:

- `introduction/`: Contains introductory materials, resources, and exercises of the introduction course.
- `data-structures/`: Contains starter code, exercises, and solutions of the data structures course.
- `basic-algorithms/`: Contains starter code, exercises, and solutions of the basic algorithms course.
- `advanced-algorithms/`: Contains starter code, exercises, and solutions of the advanced algorithms course.

## Projects

The nanodegree includes several hands-on projects designed to reinforce your understanding of data structures and algorithms:

1. **Unscramble Computer Science Problems**: Analyze and solve problems using data structures and algorithms.
2. **Show Me the Data Structures**: Implement various data structures to solve real-world problems.
3. **Problem vs. Algorithms**: Tackle a series of algorithmic problems using the best approaches.
2. **Route Planner**: Use A\* algorithms to find the shortest path between locations.
   
Each project folder contains a `README.md` with specific instructions and requirements for that project. You will also find starter code and test cases to help you get started.

## Getting Started

To get started with the course projects:

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine using the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/udacity/nd256-data-structures-and-algorithms.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory** that you want to work on.

3. **Follow the instructions** in the project's `README.md` file to set up your environment, run tests, and start coding.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning the projects, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.9+
- A code editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm)
- Basic knowledge of Python and algorithms
